Research Project Name:-  Flight_delay_prediction_without_over-relying_on_meteorological_data

I aim to bring in a paradigm shift by prioritizing systemic human factors over meteorological determinism
While atmospheric conditions offer a convenient, visible scapegoat for schedule disruptions, this research asserts that the core of predictive accuracy lies in the deconvolution of human-centric and systemic operational variables. Despite the apparent simplicity of weather-based forecasting, the true frontier of aviation resilience is the deep analysis of the interconnected human elements within the operational chain—ranging from ground-handling logistics to labour-force synchronization.

The discrepancy between current industry standards and the world’s most punctual carriers suggests that high-tier On-Time Performance (OTP) is not a result of favourable weather, but of superior modelling of internal delay catalysts. Had the industry historically prioritized the modelling of high-contribution systemic features over exogenous weather data, operational efficiency would be significantly more robust. The model proposed in this study deliberately pivots away from these transient environmental factors to capture the latent, high-impact features of the operational ecosystem. By isolating and analysing the non-weather drivers that dictate the majority of delay variances, this framework provides a high-fidelity diagnostic tool for the issues that genuinely govern airline performance.

This is the Version 2 of the project with 2 removed features and a better performance in terms of roc auc and brier scores indicating better research and moe accurate delay prediction focusing on all the non - meteorological factors involved.
